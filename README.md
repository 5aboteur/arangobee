Monjeez
=======

### What for?

Monjeez is a Java tool which can help you to *manage changes* in your MongoDB and *synchronize* them with your application.
The concept is very similar to other db migration tools such as [Liquibase](http://www.liquibase.org),
[Flyway](http://flywaydb.org), [mongeez](https://github.com/secondmarket/mongeez) but *without XML files*.

The goal is to keep this tool simple and comfortable to use.

### What's new?

Monjeez provides new approach for adding changes (change sets) based on Java classes and methods with appropriate annotations.

### What is the status?

Monjeez is still in beta phase! There are still some things to implement but it grows :)

### How to use?
